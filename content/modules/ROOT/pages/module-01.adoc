= System setup

In this lab, you will be cloning the lab helper scripts and preparing
the host, as well as setting up the required access for Red Hat resources.

[#repo]
== Installing Repositories

First, let's start by cloning the helper scripts.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/kwozyman/rh-summit-2024-lb1506
----

...and changing our directory to the newly created one:

[source,bash]
----
cd rh-summit-2024-lb1506
----

[#login]
== Red Hat registry login

In order to use the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux container images, you need to
login to Red Hat's image container registry by using your Red Hat account
credentials. If you don't have a Red Hat account or are concerned about using
your credentials on a public network, feel free to create a new personal account
that povides you with a no-cost
https://developers.redhat.com/articles/faqs-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux#general[Red Hat Developer Subscription].

[source,bash]
----
podman login registry.redhat.io
----

You will be asked for a username (this is typically the email address associated with your account) and
a password.

[#high-level]
== Preparing the host for container building

In this final part of the setup, you will:

  * setup the hypervisor for running virtual machines
  * generate a local ssh key
  * run a local container image registry
  * download all the required container images

Don't worry if this sounds like a lot, there is a script to do it all for you:

[source,bash]
----
make setup
----

[#status]
== Checking the setup

One final check before you advance to the next lab.

[source,bash]
----
make status
----

The output from the command above should be similar to the following:

----
git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
