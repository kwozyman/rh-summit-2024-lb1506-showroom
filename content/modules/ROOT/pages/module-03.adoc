= Build a bootc container image

In this lab, you will transform the previous simple containerized application into a
bootc container.

[#write]
== (re)Write the Containerfile

In the last lab, you have created a Containerfile with the following contents:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi

RUN dnf install -y httpd
RUN echo "Hello Red Hat" > /var/www/html/index.html

ENTRYPOINT /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
----

You can now use your preferred text editor (`nano Containerfile`) to modify the contents as follows:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4

RUN dnf install -y httpd
RUN echo "Hello Red Hat" > /var/www/html/index.html
RUN systemctl enable httpd.service

ENTRYPOINT /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
----

You can immediately observe two changes:

  * the `FROM` field is now pointing to the Red Hat 9.4 base bootc imageÂ `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4`
  * `RUN systemctl enable httpd.service` is added in order to start the `httpd` service at host startup

You can also take note that installation of software is still done via `dnf` and of course `systemctl` works
exactly like it would in a regular Linux system.

[#build]
== Build the first bootc image

Like with the previous simple application, you can build this container:

[source,dockerfile]
----
podman build --file Containerfile --tag summit.registry/lb1506:latest
----

If the above command is succesful, the last two lines of the output should read like this:

----
Successfully tagged summit.registry/lb1506:latest
f1bea10eb37acf2e78a9b01c6242110c1901adbaf40dbce479241c6c735c58da
----

NOTE: the above build command will be used throughout this workshop so we've
added a `make build` command that can be used instead.

[#test]
== Test the containerized application

Now that the bootc container is ready, you can test it exactly like the previous one:

[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm --name http-test --detach --publish 80:80 summit.registry/lb1506:latest
----

Test that it is running:

[source,bash]
----
podman ps | grep http-test
----

The output of the command above should read like this:

----
06a7bdb1950b  summit.registry/lb1506:latest    15 seconds ago  Up 16 seconds  0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp    http-test
----

And you can test the application:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost/
----

The result of the command above should be the "Hello Red Hat" string from the Containerfile:

----
Hello Red Hat
----

You should preserve this image by tagging it:

----
podman tag summit.registry/lb1506:latest summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

And pushing it to the local registry:

----
podman push summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

You should also stop the running container:

----
podman stop http-test
----

The resulting container looks and behaves exactly like the previous one, how can it be installed on a virtual machine?
